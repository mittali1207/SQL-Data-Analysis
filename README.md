## SQL-Data-Analysis📌 Project Description
This project is focused on performing data cleaning, management, and transformation using SQL on Microsoft SQL Server. The goal is to explore raw data and extract meaningful insights through structured queries and analytical views. It demonstrates a full data analytics workflow using SQL as the core tool.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **SQL Dialect:** Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL)
- **Tool:** SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

## 📊 Features & Analysis Performed

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
- **Database Exploration**
- **Dimension and Measure Analysis**
- **Data Range Checks**
- **Magnitude & Ranking Analysis**
- **Change Over Time Analysis**
- **Cumulative Metrics**
- **Performance Analysis**
- **Data Segmentation**
- **Part-to-Whole Analysis**

## 🧱 Project Components

### ✅ SQL Views
- **`Customer_Report_View`**  
  Provides summarized insights on customer behavior and trends.

- **`Product_Report_View`**  
  Offers performance metrics for products including sales, ranking, and contribution.

### ✅ Query Categories
- `01_database_exploration.sql`: Explore tables, relationships, and basic structure.
- 
- `02_data_cleaning.sql`: Clean and preprocess data for analysis.
- `03_dimension_exploration.sql`: Explore and understand dimension attributes.
- `04_data_range_checks.sql`: Identify and validate acceptable data ranges.
- `05_measure_analysis.sql`: Summarize key metrics (averages, totals, etc.).
- `06_magnitude_ranking.sql`: Rank entities by sales, performance, etc.
- `07_time_trend_analysis.sql`: Analyze trends and changes over time.
- `08_cumulative_metrics.sql`: Calculate cumulative values.
- `09_performance_analysis.sql`: Compare entities on KPIs.
- `10_segmentation.sql`: Group data based on behavior or categories.
- `11_part_to_whole.sql`: Analyze proportions and contributions.

## 🗃️ How to Run the Project

1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
2. Connect to your local or cloud-based SQL Server.
3. Run the SQL scripts in the recommended order (starting from `01_`).
4. Use the final views (`Customer_Report_View`, `Product_Report_View`) to power visual dashboards or reports.

> Ensure that your database contains all the required tables and sample data before running these queries.
